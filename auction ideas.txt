class Agent:
	Coord loc;
	Genome genome;
	NeuralNet brain;



Neurons ->
	Input ->
		My money
		Opponents' money
		Artifacts won (total)
		My artifacts
		Opponents' artifacts
		The current turn #
		In a bidding war [True/False]
	Middle layer ->
		Weight
		Bias
	Output -> (every player will always have these)
		Bid $[2-10]
		
Fitness measured by ->
	Score (Artifacts added up plus money)
	Difference in score between players
	
Reproduction ->
	Asexual -> just apply mutation
	Sexual -> match up players based on fitness, apply mutation

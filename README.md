# Natural Selection Experiments (with Auction card game)
 Programming experiments that simulate natural selection in different scenarios. The main objective is to try and find a good strategy for the card game "Auction."
## What is Auction?
 Auction, created by Alex Kutsenok, is a card game played with a standard 52-card deck of playing cards. It is easy to learn and very fun to play. In my opinion, it is best played with 3 to 4 players, but can be played with 2.

## What works right now
 Currently, the card game Auction is fully implemented in code and can be played by running `auction_game.py` as main. You can input the choices for each player, which are named at the bottom of the file as 'X', 'Gamer', and 'Evan'. You can add another player to the list or delete one. There is no working machine learning or natural selection yet.
